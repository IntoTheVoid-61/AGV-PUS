# AGV PUS

## Description

This is a directory that contains all the necesarry files to simulate localization and navigation of the AGV in the ROS2 enviorment.
The AGV was developed at the University of Maribor at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.
This is a work in progress and is being updated frequently.
For specific CAD files please visit the AGV-CAD repository

The template for mecanum drive controller was provided by Addison Sears-Collins: https://github.com/automaticaddison/yahboom_rosmaster/tree/main/mecanum_drive_controller


Given the specific AGV compositon i.e. physical structure it was updated specifically for our project. For useful information about robots mentioned characteristic by which
the robot was modelled in ROS (such as transformations and placements of coordinate system), please consult the CAD repository.

The sensors used for AGV:
- IMU
- Lidar
- D435 rgbd camera

This project is still underwork.


## Prerequisites
- ROS2 installed
- Python 3.x.x
